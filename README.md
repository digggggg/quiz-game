# quiz-game

## Description
I made a quiz game that uses dynamically generated html without the use of libraries. I have a timer that decrements when the wrong answer is submitted. Highscores are tracked and remembered through local storage. I learned a lot about dynamic html in js, especially what I need to keep track of. This is my first attempt at something like this. I did't pay too much attention to styling and focused more on the relationship between functions.
